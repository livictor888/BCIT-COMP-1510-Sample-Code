"""
An instructor gives five-point quizzes that are assigned letter grades
according to the scale: 5 -> A, 4 -> B, 3 -> C, 2 -> D, 1 -> F, 0 -> F.

Write a program that takes a quiz score as input and prints the grade.

Your program should work like this:
    >> Enter the quiz score: 3
    >> The letter grade is: C
