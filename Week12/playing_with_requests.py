Playing with the requests module.

The requests module is not included when we install
Python. We have to install it separately. If you mouse
over the import statement, you'll notice requests is
underlined in curly red. PyCharm will ask you if you
want it to install the requests module. Say yes.

The requests module is for HTTP requests. Super fun and
much easy.
