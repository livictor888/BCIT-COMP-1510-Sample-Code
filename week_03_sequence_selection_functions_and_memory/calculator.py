"""
This is an example of how we can pass functions around as arguments to
other functions!

A function that has been defined in a source file will be given an
address in memory just like a variable or an object. We can use the
function's address to treat it like an object. We can store it in a
variable or we can pass it to another function.

We say that in Python functions are "first class." This is a computing
expression that many programmers use. It means we can pass functions
around to other functions. Not all programming languages do this!
