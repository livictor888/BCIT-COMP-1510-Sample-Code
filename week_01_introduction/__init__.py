"""
When we create a Python package in PyCharm, we are actually creating
a directory in the project that is intended to contain Python modules.

A module in Python is a text file that ends in .py. This text file is
usually called a Python source file. It contains Python code.

For example, hello_world.py is the following things at the same time:

1. a Python source file
2. a Python script
3. a Python program
4. a Python module.

When we want to import modules into other modules to use the code
inside them, we have to specify which package the module is in.

In order for a directory to be recognized as a package, it must
contain a file called __init__.py (we call it dunder init, or
dunder init dunder where dunder means double underscore).

Later this term I will show you what we can put in here!

If you don't understand this now, don't stress out. I promise you will
understand this completely by the end of the term!
