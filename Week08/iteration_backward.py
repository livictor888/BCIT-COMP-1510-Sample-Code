# The following program traverses a list and prints the items to the screen, one per
# line. Add a second while loop that prints items in reverse order.

# Create a string ...
temp_string = "am I as happy as you are"


# Make a list from the string ...
a_list = temp_string.split()

print("-> forwards ...")

while i < len(a_list):
    print(a_list[i])
    i += 1

# Your code goes after this line.  You must iterate!
