"""
Consider a series where each number n is the sum of the 3 preceding numbers.
The series always starts with [0, 1, 1]. In this case the first 10 numbers of
the series are: [0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81].

Write a program that generates these first 10 numbers and stores them in a
list. The list is printed after each new number is added. Your program must
use a ‘for i in range’ loop. Your list should start with 0, 1, 1 already in it.
