"""
Check this out.

We have defined a global variable (gasp!). It's a dictionary that
represents the information we might store for a game character.

Note the functions in the module are concerned with one thing, and
only one thing: managing the character "object".

This is an example of a coherent module that could be used as part
of a larger program. If (and only if) we were allowed to use
global variables...
