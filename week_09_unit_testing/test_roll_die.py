        Wow! Check this out! It's a patch! I am mocking (faking) the random object.
        We call this @patch stuff an annotation. I am annotating the test function.
        We will learn more about this later in the term. When the function we are
        testing (roll_die) is called inside the test function (test_roll_die_single_roll)
        the roll_die function uses random.randint. The @patch is like patching in a
        replacement. The first parameter, random.randint, is the function we are going
        to fake. The second parameter, side_effect, is a list of "pretend" random
        numbers we will "pretend" that randint produces when roll_die uses it.
        Pretty cool, don't you think? You are mocking the random generator so you
        can create a deterministic test, a test where the randomness has been harnessed
        in order to ensure the logic in your function, not randint, is correct!"""
