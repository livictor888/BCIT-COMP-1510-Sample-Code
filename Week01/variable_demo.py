"""
We can assign values to variables. We place the variable on the left, and
the value we are putting into the variable on the right. We put an equal
sign in between.

We call the equal sign an assignment operator.

We copy the address of the value on the right into the variable on the left.

In this case, there is an integer in memory, 503, and it occupies some space.
That space has an address. That address is what we store in the variable room.

We do this because it is easier for humans to remember the word room than it
is for us to remember a location in memory like 0Xacd8343d0.

room = 503
print('I am staying in room number')
print(room)
